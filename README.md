# Password-Generator

The purpose of this assignment was to create a secure random password generator.  This secure password generator functions by prompting the user for the following criteria:

1. Password length must be between a minimum of 8 characters and maximum of 128.
2. Password contain lowercase letters
3. Password contain uppercase letters
4. Password contain numbers
5. Password contain special characters

Once the program has verified that the password length meets the minimum and maximum requirements.

It then determines which criteria the user has selected and generates a secure password string based on the user's input.  The new password is then displayed in the text area.

The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected. 

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts.
